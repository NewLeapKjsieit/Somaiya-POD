# Somaiya-POD
Official deployer of K. J. Somaiya Institute of Engineering and Information Technology's BeliefSat1
## Readme 

Somaiya *Pico-Satellite Orbital Deployer* (SomaiyaPod) is a Pocketqube Standard Deployer that is indigenously made by the undergraduate Students of **K J Somaiya of Engineering and Information Technology**. The  SomaiyaPod is a subpart of the team's proposal under the [PS4-Orbital platform program of ISRO](https://www.isro.gov.in/update/15-jun-2019/announcement-of-opportunity-ao-orbital-platform), wherein, the team aims to demonstrate the deployment of indigenously developed technologies for PocketQube standard nano-satellites. As a part of this demonstration, BeliefSat will be launched out of SomaiyaPod. The SomaiyaPod is based on the PocketQube Standards which was introduced by Alba Orbital, TU Delft, and GAUSS (Group of Astrodynamics for the Use of Space Systems). This ensures that the standard design can accommodate the various types of PocketQube standard Satellites.

### SO WHAT SOMAIYA POD WILL DO IN THE SPACE AND WHAT RESULT IT WILL GIVE ?

-To contain the satellite and protect it during the launch stage.
-Then the main objective of the deployer is to deploy the PocketQube standard satellite i.e [BeliefSat-1](https://github.com/NewLeapKjsieit/BeliefSat)
-It will also communicate with the PS4-OP whether the satellite is deployed or not.
